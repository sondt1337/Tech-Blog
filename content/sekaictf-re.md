Unfortunately, during the tournament, I was tricked into debugging the `Teyvat Travel Guide` challenge, which led me to go the wrong way and give up while making myself feel like I had no hope (when it was really only at medium level):< and lost. Quite a bit of effort for the `Guardians of the Kernel` challenge


## Azusawa‚Äôs Gacha World

The website only contains the challenge description, and is not needed to solve the challenge.


### Challenge structure analysis
In the first challenge, I received a full folder of Sekai's Gacha game (Created by Unity)

![](/images/sekaictf-re/image-7.png)

While searching through folders, I found a file named `Assembly-CSharp.dll`

![](/images/sekaictf-re/image-8.png)


Knowing it was related to Csharp, I loaded it into DnSpy to get started. Luckily, this file is not too complicated, the information is clear.

**1. Character**

![](/images/sekaictf-re/image-9.png)

**2. GachaRequest**

![](/images/sekaictf-re/image-10.png)

**3. GachaResponse**

![](/images/sekaictf-re/image-11.png)

Reading these 3 classes, I concluded that when I gacha, I will send the parameters in `GachaRequest` including `crystals`, `pulls` and `numPulls` to the server and receive `GachaResponse` containing the class `character` and which includes `flag`

### Where does the server receive requests?

**4. CreateGachaWebRequest**


![](/images/sekaictf-re/image-12.png)

```Csharp
// GachaManager
// Token: 0x06000016 RID: 22 RVA: 0x0000259C File Offset: 0x0000079C
private UnityWebRequest CreateGachaWebRequest(string json)
{
    byte[] bytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(json);
    string s = "aHR0cDovLzE3Mi44Ni42NC44OTozMDAwL2dhY2hh";
    UnityWebRequest unityWebRequest = new UnityWebRequest(Encoding.UTF8.GetString(Convert.FromBase64String(s)), "POST");
    unityWebRequest.uploadHandler = new UploadHandlerRaw(bytes);
    unityWebRequest.downloadHandler = new DownloadHandlerBuffer();
    unityWebRequest.SetRequestHeader("Content-Type", "application/json");
    unityWebRequest.SetRequestHeader("User-Agent", "SekaiCTF");
    return unityWebRequest;
}
```
`aHR0cDovLzE3Mi44Ni42NC44OTozMDAwL2dhY2hh` l√† m√£ ho√° base64 c·ªßa `http://172.86.64.89:3000/gacha`

Yah, so I have found a server + some payload setup, here I can solve it with burpsuite or send it via shell :>>, I choose via shell for convenience

P/s: There is also an option for game-style challs like this: [Cheat Engine](https://www.cheatengine.org/) is quite simple, it can determine the exact address of the objects and modify them (in this writeup I will not mention it because it is not pure REV)

### Gacha time
So, based on what I analyze, I can write a shell curl to retrieve data like I'm gacha with the example parameters being 1000, 1, 1. (ie I have 1000 diamonds, new spin 1 time and spin 1 more time)

```Shell
curl -s -X POST http://172.86.64.89:3000/gacha -d '{"crystals":1,"pulls":1,"numPulls":1}' -H 'Content-type: application/json' -H 'User-Agent: SekaiCTF' | jq .
```

![](/images/sekaictf-re/image-13.png)

Maybe I still need to open the game to check what the parameters are

![](/images/sekaictf-re/image-14.png)

Yah, here it is, the chance of winning gacha is 0% and can only be received when spinning 1 million times :)). So it's simple, because the number of spins per request is only between 1 and 10, so setup pulls will be 999999 and numPulls will be 1, and crystals will be set to 1000.

Put the jumbled part into cyberchef with base64 and convert it to an image

## Guardians of the Kernel

Author: Iyed

> ‚ùñ Note
It‚Äôs just a warmup but with another layer which is the kernel.
### Challenge analysis
In this chall, I received an attachment consisting of 2 quite strange files

![](/images/sekaictf-re/image.png)

After researching, I understand that bzImage is a kernel image file that loads and initializes the kernel while booting the system and the `.cpio` file is like a file system restorer (because it manages data structures and file lists)

![](/images/sekaictf-re/image-1.png)

So I can completely build the kernel image (here I can use qemu), but this build chall is a bit redundant (I don't need debug).

We an easily run this kernel with the command:

```Shell
qemu-system-x86_64 -kernel bzImage -initrd initramfs.cpio -nographic   -monitor none   -no-reboot -append "console=ttyS0"
```

![](/images/sekaictf-re/image-17.png)

Instead, I decompress the files in `initramfs.cpio` with the command: `cpio -idv -F inittramfs.cpio`

![](/images/sekaictf-re/image-2.png)

Notice that there is a file `flag_checker.ko` (this file contains information about loading modules into the kernel), so maybe I won't need to debug through the kernel anymore, I'll just load it into IDA

![](/images/sekaictf-re/image-3.png)

Great, there is `device_ioctl` that handles I/O Control, so I exploited this part and bonus

![](/images/sekaictf-re/image-4.png)


The main stream

```c
__int64 __fastcall device_ioctl(__int64 a1, int a2, __int64 a3)
{
  __int64 result; // rax
  unsigned __int8 *v6; // rax
  int v7; // edx
  int v8; // eax
  unsigned int v9; // eax
  __int64 v10; // rdx

  if ( a2 == 28673 )
  {
    if ( !layers[1] )
      return 0LL;
    if ( !copy_from_user(buffer, a3, 7LL) )
    {
      buffer[7] = 0;
      v6 = buffer;
      while ( (unsigned __int8)(*v6 - 48) <= 9u )
      {
        if ( &buffer[7] == ++v6 )
        {
          v7 = 7 * __ROL4__(1507359807 * __ROR4__(422871738 * *(_DWORD *)buffer, 15), 11);
          v8 = __ROR4__(422871738 * ((buffer[5] << 8) ^ (buffer[6] << 16) ^ buffer[4]), 15);
          v9 = 1984242169
             * ((v7 + 1204333666) ^ (1507359807 * v8) ^ 7 ^ (((v7 + 1204333666) ^ (unsigned int)(1507359807 * v8)) >> 16));
          if ( (((-1817436554 * ((v9 >> 13) ^ v9)) >> 16) ^ (-1817436554 * ((v9 >> 13) ^ v9))) != 261736481 )
            return 0LL;
          return device_ioctl_cold();
        }
      }
      return 0LL;
    }
    return -14LL;
  }
  if ( a2 == 28674 )
  {
    if ( !layers[2] )
      return 0LL;
    v10 = copy_from_user(buffer, a3, 12LL);
    if ( !v10 )
    {
      do
      {
        buffer[v10] += buffer[v10 + 1] * ~(_BYTE)v10;
        ++v10;
      }
      while ( v10 != 12 );
      if ( *(_QWORD *)buffer != 0x788C88B91D88AF0ELL || *(_DWORD *)&buffer[8] != 2113081836 || buffer[12] )
        return 0LL;
      printk(&unk_2EB, a3);
      return 1LL;
    }
    return -14LL;
  }
  if ( a2 != 28672 )
  {
    printk(&unk_302, a3);
    return 0LL;
  }
  if ( copy_from_user(buffer, a3, 6LL) )
    return -14LL;
  if ( *(_DWORD *)buffer != 1095451987 || *(_WORD *)&buffer[4] != 31561 )
    return 0LL;
  printk(&unk_2B6, a3);
  result = 1LL;
  layers[1] = 1;
  return result;
}
```

As in the text view, we can see that the format of the flag is `SEKAI{`, then that is the end of the stream <-- Change the value from dec to char for clearer display

```c
if ( *(_DWORD *)buffer != 'AKES' || *(_WORD *)&buffer[4] != '{I' )
```
### Processing layer 1
Maybe this is the part that takes up all my time during the tournament :)))), being lazy should be punished by God :(

```c
if ( !copy_from_user(buffer, a3, 7LL) )
    {
      buffer[7] = 0;
      v6 = buffer;
      while ( (unsigned __int8)(*v6 - 48) <= 9u )
      {
        if ( &buffer[7] == ++v6 )
        {
          v7 = 7 * __ROL4__(1507359807 * __ROR4__(422871738 * *(_DWORD *)buffer, 15), 11);
          v8 = __ROR4__(422871738 * ((buffer[5] << 8) ^ (buffer[6] << 16) ^ buffer[4]), 15);
          v9 = 1984242169
             * ((v7 + 1204333666) ^ (1507359807 * v8) ^ 7 ^ (((v7 + 1204333666) ^ (unsigned int)(1507359807 * v8)) >> 16));
          if ( (((-1817436554 * ((v9 >> 13) ^ v9)) >> 16) ^ (-1817436554 * ((v9 >> 13) ^ v9))) != 261736481 )
            return 0LL;
          return device_ioctl_cold();
        }
      }
      return 0LL;
    }
```

After writing a lot of failed solutions using rev, I switched to bruteforce.

It can be seen that layer 1 contains 7 chars, the algorithm is a bit complicated (and still confused between signed and unsigned type), so I will bruteforce this quickly (actually, while thinking about how to write bruteforce, I can finish the third rev challenge üêß)

script bruteforce: 
```py
def __ROL4__(val, bits, bit_size=32):
    return (val << bits % bit_size) & (2 ** bit_size - 1) | ((val & (2 ** bit_size - 1)) >> (bit_size - (bits % bit_size)))

def __ROR4__(val, bits, bit_size=32):
    return ((val & (2 ** bit_size - 1)) >> bits % bit_size) | (val << (bit_size - (bits % bit_size)) & (2 ** bit_size - 1))

for i in range(10000000):
  f = str(i).rjust(7, '0').encode()
  tmp = (f[3] << 24) | (f[2] << 16) | (f[1] << 8) | f[0]

  v7 = 7 * __ROL4__(1507359807 * __ROR4__(422871738 * tmp, 15), 11)
  v8 = __ROR4__(422871738 * ((f[5] << 8) ^ (f[6] << 16) ^ f[4]), 15)
  v9 = 1984242169 * (((v7 + 0x47C8AC62) & 0xFFFFFFFF) ^ ((1507359807 * v8) & 0xFFFFFFFF) ^ 7 ^ ((((v7 + 0x47C8AC62) & 0xFFFFFFFF) ^ ((1507359807 * v8) & 0xFFFFFFFF)) >> 16))
  v9 &= 0xFFFFFFFF
  if ((((2477530742 * ((v9 >> 13) ^ v9)) & 0xFFFFFFFF) >> 16) ^ ((2477530742 * ((v9 >> 13) ^ v9)) & 0xFFFFFFFF)) == 261736481:
    print(f)
```

--> `6001337`

The solution other with z3 makes me bitter
```py
from z3 import *

buffer = [BitVec(f'x{i}', 8) for i in range(7)]
_buffer = buffer[:]
buffer = [ZeroExt(24, x) for x in buffer]

v8 = 7 * RotateLeft(1507359807 * RotateRight(422871738 * Concat(*_buffer[:4][::-1]), 15), 11)
v9 = RotateRight(422871738 * ((buffer[5] << 8) ^ (buffer[6] << 16) ^ buffer[4]), 15)
v10 = 1984242169 * ((v8 + 1204333666) ^ (1507359807 * v9) ^ 7 ^ LShR((v8 + 1204333666) ^ (1507359807 * v9), 16))

s = Solver()

s.add([And(x >= 0x30, x <= 0x39) for x in _buffer])

shr13 = (LShR(v10, 13) ^ v10)
s.add((LShR((-1817436554 * shr13), 16) ^ (-1817436554 * shr13)) == 261736481)

print(bytes([s.model()[x].as_long() for x in _buffer]))
```

### Check layer 2
```c
v10 = copy_from_user(buffer, a3, 12LL);
if ( !v10 )
{
  do
  {
    buffer[v10] += buffer[v10 + 1] * ~(_BYTE)v10;
    ++v10;
  }
  while ( v10 != 12 );
  if ( *(_QWORD *)buffer != 0x788C88B91D88AF0ELL || *(_DWORD *)&buffer[8] != 2113081836 || buffer[12] )
    return 0LL;
  printk(&unk_2EB, a3);
  return 1LL;
    }
```

Layer 2, although it has 12 char, is easier to solve. Here, we will have 1 more hint to make solving easier, that the last character will be "}" :>

There are also other conditions:

- buffer[i] += buffer[i + 1] * ~(_BYTE)v10; (i from 0 to 12)
- buffer[12] = 0 so buffer[11] = '}'

Based on this, I can build the code through z3:

```py
def solve_buffer():
    s = Solver()
    buffer = [BitVec(i, 8) for i in range(13)]
    buffer_ = [BitVec(i, 8) for i in range(13)]

    for i in range(12):
        buffer_[i] = buffer[i] + buffer[i + 1] * ~BitVecVal(i, 8)

    for i in range(12):
        s.add(And(buffer[i] >= 0x20, buffer[i] <= 0x7e))

    s.add(Concat(buffer_[7], buffer_[6], buffer_[5], buffer_[4], buffer_[3], buffer_[2], buffer_[1], buffer_[0]) == 0x788C88B91D88AF0E)
    s.add(Concat(buffer_[11], buffer_[10], buffer_[9], buffer_[8]) == 2113081836)

    if s.check() == sat:
        x = s.model()
        result = []
        for i in range(13):
            result.append(int(str(x[buffer[i]])))
        return result
    else:
        return None

def main():
    result = solve_buffer()
    print(''.join(chr(val) for val in result))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## SekaiCTF 2023 - REV Reviews
1. The reverse challenges of SekaiCTF are diverse, new + extremely difficult
2. If I let myself play only one topic, I'll probably cry, so I should play a few more to keep rank :<
3. The most unfortunate thing about this tournament is probably not re3 but the lack of pwn1 (wasting too much time doing pwn2), that's all, stopping at top xx/981 is good, next year I will take revenge: >
